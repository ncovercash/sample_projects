# Powerful digit sum

A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one‐hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two‐hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
